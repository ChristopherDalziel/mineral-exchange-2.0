# Mineral Exchange

### What problem are you solving by building this partiular marketplae app?
For this assignment I'm designing a web marketplace designed for sellers and collectors of rocks, fossils and minerals. My decision to chose this direction is because I have a close friend who is an avid collector who needs to release a large majority of their collection. Outside of Ebay and Facebook marketplace there isn't really specialized marketplace options, the websites I have been able to find online are companies selling but don't allow a collector to sell their own collection. These websites also often very clunky and slow using inefficent image files with very basic design. <br>

### Why is this a problem that needs solving? 
Rock sellers / collectors need JUSTICE
